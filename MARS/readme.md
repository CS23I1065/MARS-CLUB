#LIGHT DOSE

In the Linux and Ubuntu part,I had a very little experience because of programming lab
But that knowledge is not enough for doing this task.This dose gave me small idea about Linux and Ubuntu

**PART-1**

I learnt this using geeks for geeks and youtube . I got many errors while executing and I learnt a very few commands

**PART-2**

Most irrating part of this whole task is bash shell scripting,It is mentioned as light dose
but I felt this as the worst part but somehow I got something

#MEDIUM DOSE

I learned a new programming language C++,It basic syntaxs within 1.5 hours but learning other concepts took more time.But I can only able to submit part-1

**PART-1**

This question is my first c++ question,I got too many errors.For my 30-35 lines of code,I got errors at line no 188,180.This question doesn't test my patience much,I got it after around 20 minutes of restructure and correcting syntax in the code

**PART-2**

For this question,I learnt the oops and class throughouly but I can't able to apply it because of time constraints and also I didn't understand about the intra communication.Anyways I going to take this as a challege and going to do this question.

#STRONG DOSE

The less time that I allocated is for strong dose.

**PART-1**

Actually,I know this code is not efficient and It doesn't satisfy the requirements fully but it can work till some extend.As I did this in C.It took me very less time.

**PART-2**

I didn't even start this question because I saw that opencv concept has more videos in youtube
I will try learn about this in due time

#CONCLUSION

I cannot even imagine how I tried to learn all this is in very less time

1.C++
2.Markdown
3.Linux
4.Ubuntu
5.OpenCV

This whole task made me to realise my whole potential that I can learn many concepts in less time.I know that this is a very small part and I myself know I could have done more but anyways thank you for making me to learn something
**THANK YOU**
