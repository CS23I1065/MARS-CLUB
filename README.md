## LIGHT DOSE

Because of the programming lab, I had very little experience with the Linux and Ubuntu sections. However, that knowledge is insufficient to complete this task.This dose introduced me to Ubuntu and Linux on a liitle amount.This introduced me 
*1-LINUX*
*2-UBUNTU*
*3-VIRTUAL BOX*

**PART-1**

I discovered this through YouTube and Geeks for Geeks. I learned very few commands and got a lot of errors when executing.
My commands includes sudo apt,mkdir-Make directory,pwd-Present working directory,echo-Is for printing the statement

**PART-2**

Although bash shell scripting is described as a light dose, I found it to be the most difficult aspect of the entire task. By Some  way I managed to get something out of it.
In Bash shell scripting the all the .txt in current directory has been changed to .bak and pushed in to different directory with the help of type,mkdir etc..  

## MEDIUM DOSE

I spent 1.5 hours learning the fundamentals of the new programming language C++, but it took more time to study the other concepts.Sadly, I can able to submit part one.

**PART-1**

This question is my first c++ question,I got too many errors.For my 30-35 lines of code,I got errors at line no 188,180.This question doesn't test my patience much,I got it after around 20 minutes of restructure and correcting syntax in the code

**PART-2**

For this question,I learnt the oops and class throughouly but I can't able to apply it because of time constraints and also I didn't understand about the intra communication.Anyways I going to take this as a challege and going to do this question.

## STRONG DOSE

The less time that I allocated is for strong dose.

**PART-1**

Actually,I know this code is not efficient and It doesn't satisfy the requirements fully but it can work till some extend.As I did this in C.It took me very less time.

**PART-2**

I didn't even start this question because I saw that opencv concept has more videos in youtube I will try learn about this in due time

## CONCLUSION

I cannot even imagine how I tried to learn all this is in very less time

1.C++ 
2.Markdown 
3.Linux 
4.Ubuntu 
5.OpenCV

This whole task made me to realise my whole potential that I can learn many concepts in less time.I know that this is a very small part and I myself know I could have done more but anyways thank you for making me to learn something THANK YOU
